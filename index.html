    Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, the esteemed Indian scientist and the 11th President of India from 2002 to
    2007, entered this world on October 15, 1931. Renowned for his pivotal contributions to missile and nuclear weapon
    projects, he earned the well-deserved moniker "The Missile Man." Despite his remarkable achievements, Kalam
    maintained a remarkably humble and unassuming lifestyle. He possessed a deep fondness for literature and even
    composed poetry. Remarkably, he never married, and he was known for personally addressing his failures while
    attributing success to others. Dr. Kalam remained active and dedicated until his very last moments, passing away
    while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM).
